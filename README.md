# 🎨 Random Color Generator

A lightweight and fun static web app built with **Next.js** that displays a new random background color on every page load. This project showcases deploying static websites to AWS using **Pulumi** and **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** principles.

## 📁 Project Structure

-   `/app`: The main Next.js app (exported as static HTML).
-   `/pulumi`: Infrastructure code to deploy to AWS S3 + CloudFront using Pulumi (written in TypeScript).

## ⚙️ How It Works

Each time you refresh the page, the background color changes randomly using a `generateRandomColor()` function in JavaScript.  The app is statically exported using `next export` and deployed securely using AWS services via Pulumi.

---

## 🛠️ Deployment Using Pulumi

The infrastructure is defined in TypeScript and includes:

### 1. **S3 Bucket (Private)**

-   Hosts the exported static site.
-   Blocked public access.
-   Configured using `BucketV2` and `BucketWebsiteConfigurationV2`.

### 2. **CloudFront Distribution**

-   Serves content from S3 securely.
-   Uses **Origin Access Identity (OAI)** to restrict S3 access.
-   Enforces HTTPS.
-   Handles 403 and 404 errors by falling back to `index.html`.

### 3. **Pulumi Features**

-   Modular and readable IaC setup.
-   Uses Pulumi Copilot suggestions (refined manually).
-   Recursive file upload using `BucketObject`.

## 📦 Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/raibove/random-color-generator.git
cd random-color-generator
```

2. Install Dependencies
npm install
Use code with caution.
Bash
3. Export the Next.js App
npm run build
npm run export
Use code with caution.
Bash
This creates a static version of your site in the out/ folder.

🧱 Deploy to AWS Using Pulumi
Prerequisites:

AWS credentials configured (via aws configure)

Pulumi CLI installed

Node.js installed

1. Install Pulumi Dependencies
cd pulumi
npm install
Use code with caution.
Bash
2. Preview the Stack
pulumi preview
Use code with caution.
Bash
3. Deploy
pulumi up
Use code with caution.
Bash
Pulumi will:

Create an S3 bucket and CloudFront distribution.

Upload your static files.

Print the CloudFront domain URL.

🔐 Secure Access with OAI
The app is served via CloudFront with an Origin Access Identity (OAI) so that:

The S3 bucket remains private.

Only CloudFront can fetch the content.

This avoids making the bucket publicly accessible while keeping the site fast and secure.

🧹 Refactoring Highlights
✅ Switched from Bucket to BucketV2 for future-proofing.

✅ Used BucketWebsiteConfigurationV2 for clear separation of concerns.

✅ Integrated OAI cleanly with predictable policies.

✅ Simplified file uploads with better privacy and organization.

🤖 Using Pulumi Copilot
Prompts used:

"Deploy a static site to AWS using S3 and CloudFront with Pulumi in TypeScript."

"How do I make sure S3 is only accessible through CloudFront?"

"How to configure custom error responses for a single page app?"

Pulumi Copilot provided helpful scaffolding, but manual refactoring ensured a clean and modular setup.

🔄 What's Next: CI/CD with GitHub Actions
1. Set up AWS Credentials in GitHub Secrets
Go to your GitHub repository's settings -> Secrets -> Actions.

Add the following secrets:

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: Your AWS Access Key ID.

AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: Your AWS Secret Access Key.

AWS_REGION: Your AWS Region (e.g., us-east-1).

PULUMI_ACCESS_TOKEN: Your Pulumi access token (create one at https://app.pulumi.com/account/settings/tokens).

2. Create a GitHub Actions Workflow
Create a file .github/workflows/deploy.yml with the following content:

name: Deploy to AWS with Pulumi

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Build and export Next.js app
        run: |
          npm run build
          npm run export

      - name: Configure AWS Credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2
        with:
          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws-region: ${{ secrets.AWS_REGION }}

      - name: Install Pulumi CLI
        uses: pulumi/actions@v4
        with:
          version: v3.0.0
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Install Pulumi Dependencies
        working-directory: ./pulumi
        run: npm install

      - name: Deploy with Pulumi
        working-directory: ./pulumi
        env:
          PULUMI_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PULUMI_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
        run: pulumi up --yes
Use code with caution.
Yaml
This workflow will:

Trigger on pushes to the main branch.

Checkout the code.

Set up Node.js.

Install dependencies.

Build and export the Next.js app.

Configure AWS credentials using GitHub Secrets.

Install the Pulumi CLI.

Deploy the infrastructure using pulumi up.

Now, every time you push to the main branch, the GitHub Actions workflow will automatically deploy your static site to AWS using Pulumi.

Further Enhancements:

Manage multiple stacks (e.g., dev, prod) for staging and production environments.

Use a Pulumi Cloud backend for state management.

Implement automated testing and validation.

📚 Learnings
S3 and CloudFront can serve static sites securely and efficiently.

Pulumi allows writing infrastructure in real code (TypeScript!), making it readable and maintainable.

Understanding AWS resource relationships (OAI, policies) helps avoid common pitfalls.

BucketV2 and modular Pulumi setup = cleaner, future-ready IaC.
